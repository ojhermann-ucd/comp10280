"""
Taking the program to calculate the factorial of a number presented in class, 
investigate how it would be possible to have just two cases, one where the number is less than 0 and one where it isnâ€™t. 
Rewrite the program to do this.
Save this program as p11p1.py.

Pseudocode
user inputs integer
if integer is negative, message and exit
if integer is positive:
     use a count variable set to the integer value
     first multiply it by one, then decrement, and repeat until the count is one
