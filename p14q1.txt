Methodology
- Measurement of time done with time.perf_counter()
- this was chosen because it will compare intervals of time based on the CPU counter i.e. let me know which algorithm for which value runs better on my machine

Non-recursive function from p12p1.py		Recursive function from p13p6.py
Input		Time							Input		Time
100			1.87							100			2.47			
1,000		2.30							1,000		Recursion error: maximum depth exceeded while calling a Python object	
10,000		5.71							10,000			
100,000		10.82							100,000			

Two comments
- Python sets the limit to stack depth at a default of 1000 (sys.getrecursionlimit); I could change this using sys.setrecursion limit, but I'd rather not mess with my computer too much this evening.
- recursion can be intense on memory, so it would make more sense to use a specific approach (e.g. LRU algorithms) and the speed of the recusrive method would be much better
