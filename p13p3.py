Implement the program that uses the print max function from todayâ€™s lectures (Page 9 of the notes).
Ensure that you understand what is going on and how it works. Save this program as p13p3.py.

Program to print out the largest of two numbers entered by the user
Uses two functions:  max and print_max

Pseudocode
- place p13p2.py inside of another function (you have access to this for its pseudocode)
- include user input requests within this function
- print the results of the inputs in the max_example function
