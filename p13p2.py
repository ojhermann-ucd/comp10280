Implement the programs that illustrate the definition and use of functions in Python from todayâ€™s lectures (Pages 4 and 5 of the notes).
Save these programs as p13p1.py and p13p2.py, respectively.


Program to print out the largest of two numbers entered by the user
Uses a function max
Uses max in a print statement


Pseudocode
define function:
	return greater of two numbers

have user input floating numbesr; exit with message otherwise

print messages using function in the print statement
